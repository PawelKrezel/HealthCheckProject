#Hello! This is a project which I developed in collaboration with my coursemates from the University of Westminster for the "Software Development Group Project" module
This was built in Django for the SkyTV team

Python 3.13.0
Django 5.1.7





Underneath you'll see the original content of the readme file from the development phase:

# This repository is for Software Development Group Project. 🌱

This contains important information regarding our project, please, read it. 

1. Comment your code, this is good for your own understanding of your work and for your peers.
2. Be consistent! In order to ensure we finish the project on time, we must work every week on our project, even if it's a few hours only.
3. Ensure that everytime you make changes you comment what you have done so your peers can follow along with your work and help if necessary.
4. If you have any issues, questions, comments, please do not hesitate to contact your peers! 

---- Remember that every Friday you're expected to update your colleagues on your progress for the week and your plans for the next. 
We expect to hear a bit about your commits, what's working, what's not working and what will you be doing about it. 
Plan ahead and dedicate time to your tasks to ensure you're staying on track. ----

# This is the Dev branch 🐛🌱
This branch will be where we merge the changes to keep from breaking any working code that is on main.

1. You should clone the repository on VS code, create your own branch and then issue a pull request to get the folders into your VS code.
2. Any pushes and commits should be done in your own branch first and should be working, before pushing to Dev.
3. If any changes are pushed to Dev by another colleague, do not forget to make a pull request on VS code so you have the latest changes.
4. When making commits, make sure to add a comment about what it is that you're changing or what you have done.
